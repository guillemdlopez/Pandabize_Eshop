  "user_id": 6,
  "amount": 20.57,
  "customization_ids": [123, 125, 128]
}
```

This is the API's response (JSON format):

```json
{
  "id": 10,
  "bicycle_id": 17,
  "amount": 20.57,
  "user_id": 6,
  "created_at": "2021-03-08T16:25:30.409Z",
  "updated_at": "2021-03-08T16:25:30.409Z"
}
```

_If you want to see all the customizations related to your order, then you can check out the `GET order 'api/v1/order/:id'` endpoint specifying the id of the order you just created_
